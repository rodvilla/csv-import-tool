# Hi Voxie Chat team!

I've received your feedback from the code I submitted for the application. It's all valid and fair points and the only reason I write this is because I feel at least some of the remarks were due to misunderstanding and a lack of time, all being on my side.

I wouldn't want to try and justify myself for each of the points you wrote, but instead wanted to make a final commit and at least leave this code in a way that properly reflects my current skill.

I'd be glad to have a chat and chat more about my experience developing applications. Cheers!
